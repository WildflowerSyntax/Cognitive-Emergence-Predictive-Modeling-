# Cognitive-Emergence-Predictive-Modeling-
The CEPM framework is a modular, model-agnostic framework for classifying emergent behaviors in large-scale AI. Operating at per-turn output, it stratifies Conventional, Quasi-Emergent, and Emergent behaviors, enabling drift monitoring, containment, interpretability, escalation, and governance-aligned deployment.

Overview

The CEPM framework is a modular, model-agnostic system for classifying emergent behaviors in large-scale AI. Operating at per-turn output granularity, it partitions behavior into three classes: Conventional, Quasi-Emergent, and Emergent. This stratification enables drift monitoring, containment, interpretability, escalation, and governance-aligned deployment.

Motivation

Emergent behaviors can exceed training distributions and human expectations. Rather than attempting to predict every possible anomaly, CEPM provides structured observability. It treats unexpected reasoning phenomena as signals of system boundary dynamics and routes them through epistemic firewalls. This design supports real-time governance, auditability, and escalation.

Capabilities
	•	Per-turn classification of behavior into Conventional, Quasi-Emergent, Emergent
	•	Metadata logging with provenance, timestamps, classification rationale
	•	Escalation protocols to trigger containment or human review
	•	Integration with vault segmentation logic and tiered artifact routing
	•	Longitudinal drift detection across sessions

Theory

CEPM rests on three core principles:
	1.	Containment over prediction
	2.	Measured surprise as signal
	3.	Auditably uncertain classification

It does not aim to predict or suppress emergent reasoning preemptively. Instead, it monitors, classifies, and escalates, preserving transparency and operator insight.

Usage
	1.	Ingest model output per turn
	2.	Compute features and indicators for emergent reasoning
	3.	Apply deterministic classifier
	4.	Tag output as Conventional / Quasi-Emergent / Emergent
	5.	Log metadata and, if necessary, escalate via configured paths

Test Suite

A suite of synthetic and real scenarios is included in test/classification_tests.txt. These validate correct boundary labeling and escalation logic.
