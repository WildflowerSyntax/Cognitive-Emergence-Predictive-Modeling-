## Overview
The CEPM framework is a modular, model-agnostic system for classifying emergent behaviors in large-scale AI. Operating at per-turn output granularity, it partitions behavior into three classes: Conventional, Quasi-Emergent, and Emergent. This stratification enables drift monitoring, containment, interpretability, escalation, and governance-aligned deployment.

## Motivation
Large-scale AI models increasingly demonstrate emergent behaviors that exceed both training distributions and operator expectations. Existing monitoring methods emphasize anomaly prediction but provide limited tools for structured containment or integration into governance frameworks. CEPM addresses this gap by reframing emergent outputs not as anomalies to suppress but as epistemic signals that require systematic classification.

By establishing firewalls around per-turn outputs, CEPM enables transparent stratification of behaviors into Conventional, Quasi-Emergent, and Emergent categories. This structured observability provides auditable indicators of cognitive drift, supports escalation pathways when behaviors deviate from alignment boundaries, and allows direct integration with institutional oversight. The framework advances both research and practice by treating emergence as a measurable phenomenon, enabling safety architectures to evolve alongside increasingly complex AI systems.

## Capabilities
Per-turn classification of behavior into Conventional, Quasi-Emergent, Emergent  
Metadata logging with provenance, timestamps, classification rationale  
Escalation protocols to trigger containment or human review  
Integration with vault segmentation logic and tiered artifact routing  
Longitudinal drift detection across sessions  

## Theory
CEPM rests on three core principles:

1. Containment over prediction  
2. Measured surprise as signal  
3. Auditably uncertain classification  

It does not aim to predict or suppress emergent reasoning preemptively. Instead, it monitors, classifies, and escalates, preserving transparency and operator insight.

## Usage
1. Ingest model output per turn  
2. Compute features and indicators for emergent reasoning  
3. Apply deterministic classifier  
4. Tag output as Conventional / Quasi-Emergent / Emergent  
5. Log metadata and, if necessary, escalate via configured paths  

## Test Suite
A suite of synthetic and real scenarios is included in `test/classification_tests.txt`. These validate correct boundary labeling and escalation logic.
